#summary Specification for the possibilities of opening OnlineVideos with a parameter

= Introduction =

Starting with MediaPortal 1.2 a designer can add a button in the skinfile that calls any Plugin with a parameter. This allows calling OnlineVideos showing a given Site, Category or results of a search. You can also use GuiProperties inside the parameter, they are resolved before handed to the plugin.

= Details =

This is the full parameter specification (each term is optional, order is irrelevant):

site:{{{<sitename>}}}|category:{{{<categoryname>}}}|search:{{{<searchstring>}}}|VKonfail:{{{<true,false>}}}|return:{{{<Locked,Root>}}}

Settings theses terms (seperated by |) will allow going directly to:

   # a Site (not found = stay at 'All Sites view')
   # a Category of a Site (not found = stay at 'All Categories View')
   # the searchresults of a site (nothing found =
          * return after showing 'Nothing Found message'
          * open virtual keyboard with given searchstring(default))

with one of these return modes (PreviousMenu):

   # Go back up to the all sites view of OnlineVideos before returning to the window you came from (default)
   # When at the view OnlineVideos was called with, PreviousMenu will return to the window you came from
