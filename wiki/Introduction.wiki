<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />
----
= Introduction =
This plugin integrates websites that host videos or stream live tv into <a href="http://www.team-mediaportal.com/">MediaPortal</a>.
Examples are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> and <a href="http://www.wwitv.com/">wwitv</a>.

The videos/streams can be discovered by reading RSS feeds or parsing HTML. Only direct links to video files or streams can be played back, because they will be rendered using [http://wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectShow directshow]. This allows usage of your favorite codecs to control audio and video quality (e.g. using ffdshow you can upscale low quality videos as well as upmix stereo sound and output to spdif).

The main view of the plugin at first shows a list of all sites that can be viewed. By selecting a site you can dive into the categories for that site. If a category has subcategories (e.g. Miro), by selecting a category you will dive into the subcategories recursivly, otherwise a list of videos for that category is shown. Each of these 3 views  can be shown as a list, small thumbs or large thumbs.
