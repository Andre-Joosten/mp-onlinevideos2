= Table of Contents =
<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />
----
= Introduction =
This plugin integrates websites that host videos or stream live tv into <a href="http://www.team-mediaportal.com/">MediaPortal</a>.
Examples are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> and <a href="http://www.wwitv.com/">wwitv</a>.

The videos/streams can be discovered by reading RSS feeds, parsing HTML, programming against provided APIs or directly adding urls of live streams. Only direct links to video files or streams (.flv, .mp4, ...) can be played back, because they will be rendered using <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectShow">directshow</a>. This allows usage of your favorite codecs to control audio and video quality (e.g. using ffdshow you can upscale low quality videos as well as upmix stereo sound and output to spdif) and gives the best integration with MediaPortal.

Each of these 3 views  can be shown as a list, small thumbs or large thumbs.
