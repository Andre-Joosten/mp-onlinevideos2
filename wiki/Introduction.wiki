#summary Overall description of the OnlineVideos plugin for MediaPortal.

= Introduction =

This plugin integrates websites that host videos or stream live tv into <a href="http://www.team-mediaportal.com/">MediaPortal</a>.
Examples are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> and <a href="http://www.wwitv.com/">wwitv</a>.

The videos/streams can be discovered by reading RSS feeds or parsing HTML. Only direct links to video files or streams can be played back, because they will be rendered using [http://wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectShow directshow]. This allows usage of your favorite codecs to control audio and video quality (e.g. using ffdshow you can upscale low quality videos as well as upmix stereo sound and output to spdif).

These 3 views all can be shown as a line-by-line list, small thumbs list or large thumbs list.
